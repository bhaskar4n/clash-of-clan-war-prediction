clash of clan war prediction

I have created a clan war prediction python program using keras machine learning library.

for this war prediction, I have created a train datasets and test datasets and these datasets are collected from the coc warlog.

for training the neural network,  i have used <strong> clan_train_dataset.json</strong> file and this data is from my clan warlog. 

for testing the neural network, i have used <strong>clan_test_dataset.json</strong> file and this data is collected from an another clan warlog.
for testing the neural network, you can also user your own clan warlog data.
inputs for neural network:
1. destruction percentage
2. clan Level
3. stargs
4. attacks
5. expEarned
6. teamSize
opponent clan:
7. clanLevel
8. stars
9. destruction percentage 
 
outputs:
win = 1 or lose = 0

for your information, i have considered win as 1 and lose as 0.
